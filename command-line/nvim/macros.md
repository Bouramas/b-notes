## Macros

Macros is way to record the sequence of buttons you press and store them in a register (a-z). Then when you finish recording, you can execute this macro by triggering the macro in the specific register you stored it.

Start recording with q folowed by the register e.g. qa - stores the macro in register a 
Execute the required steps - e.g. Add quotations to the line, move to the next line
Hit q again to stop recording the macro
Trigger the macro with the @ symbol and the number of times you want to execute it e.g.  10@a will execute the macro in register a, 10 times
