## Zoxide Navigation

Zoxide is a better cd tool - it is exactly the same with the cd command but stores a history
of the directories you have visited. This allows for easy navigation between paths without
the need to specify the whole path.

i.e. if you are regularly visiting a path /a/b/c/d/e/notes you can just type
`zoxide notes` and be directly navigated to the path. 

Note: make sure to initialize zoxide through your zsh profile with the cd command instead. This way
you can keep using `cd` while `zoxide` is run behind the scenes.
