== GoLang Language Questions

=== Does Go support inheritance?

Go does not support traditional inheritance like class-based object-oriented languages. Instead, it supports composition and interfaces to achieve similar goals. Composition involves embedding types within a struct to reuse behavior, while interfaces provide polymorphism.

=== What is the difference between switch and select in Go?

* **switch**:
  * Used for conditional control flow based on the value of a variable.
  * Supports multiple expressions and cases with fallthrough behavior.

* **select**:
  * Used for concurrent control flow to choose between multiple communication operations.
  * Used with channels and blocks until one of its cases can proceed.

=== What is the difference between methods and functions in Go?

* **Functions**:
  * Standalone blocks of code that can be called with arguments.
  * Defined using the `func` keyword outside of any struct.

* **Methods**:
  * Functions associated with a specific type (struct).
  * Defined using the `func` keyword followed by the receiver type, like `(t Type)`.

=== What is the internal package in Go?

The internal package mechanism in Go is designed to restrict access to certain parts of a codebase, making them accessible only within the module or parent directory in which they reside. This enforces a level of encapsulation by preventing external packages from importing and using internal code, thereby helping developers to better manage dependencies and the exposure of implementation details.

=== Testing Package in Go

* Package `testing` provides support for automated testing of Go packages.
* `go test` command automates execution of any function of the form `func TestXxx(*testing.T)`.
* Filename ending in `_test.go`. The file will be excluded from regular package builds but will be included when the `go test` command is run.
* The test file can be in the same package as the one being tested, or in a corresponding package with the suffix `_test`.

=== Go Benchmark Tests

* **Benchmarks**: Functions of the form `func BenchmarkXxx(*testing.B)` are considered benchmarks and are executed by the `go test` command when its `-bench` flag is provided.
* Benchmarks are run sequentially.

=== Go Fuzzing Tests

* **Fuzzing**: `go test` and the testing package support fuzzing, a testing technique where a function is called with randomly generated inputs to find bugs not anticipated by unit tests.
* Functions of the form `func FuzzXxx(*testing.F)` are considered fuzz tests.

=== Mocking Techniques in Go

* Manually creating mock objects.
* Implementing interfaces.
* Using function callbacks.
* Using the GoMock framework for mock generation.

=== What is a goroutine?

In Go, each concurrently executing activity is called a goroutine.

=== Differences Between Buffered and Unbuffered Channel

Both channels serve as mechanisms for goroutines to communicate and synchronize.

* **Buffered Channel**:
  * Allows sending multiple values into the channel without a corresponding receiver.
  * Capacity is defined during channel creation (`make(chan T, capacity)`).

* **Unbuffered Channel**:
  * Requires a sender and receiver to be ready simultaneously for communication.
  * No capacity is specified (`make(chan T)`), making it synchronous.

=== Channel Directions in Go

Channels can be declared with send-only (`chan<- T`), receive-only (`<-chan T`), or bidirectional (`chan T`) directions.

=== What is the use of panic in Go?

`panic` is used to terminate a function execution immediately.
* Typically used for unrecoverable errors or exceptional situations.
* It triggers the deferred functions and may be recovered using `recover()` in deferred functions.
