== SQL/NoSQL related questions

=== Primary Key, Foreign Key, and Unique Constraint

* Primary Key - Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
* Foreign Key - Establishes a relationship between two tables.
* Unique Constraint - Ensures all values in a column are unique.

=== How would you optimise a slow query? What are some common techniques?

==== Indexing:
* Create indexes on columns used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses.
* Fix read performance on your database but might slow down write performance.

==== Connection Pooling:
* Maintain a number of connections and reuse them.

==== Query Refinement:
* Avoid `SELECT *`, specify only needed columns.
* Use `EXPLAIN` to understand query execution plans.
* Rewrite complex queries to reduce joins and subqueries.

==== Database Schema Design:
* Normalize to reduce redundant data.
* Denormalize for read-heavy workloads if necessary.

==== Efficient Joins and Conditions:
* Ensure joins use indexed columns.
* Use appropriate join types (INNER JOIN vs LEFT JOIN).

==== Application level caching:
* Implement query caching for frequently accessed data.

Is the read performance slow or the write performance?
* Materialised views will improve your read performance but adds extra load on the database server that may impact write performance.

=== ACID Properties in a DB transaction

* Atomicity: Ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed; if not, the transaction is aborted.
* Consistency: Ensures the database remains in a consistent state before and after the transaction.
* Isolation: Ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
* Durability: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, it remains so, even in the event of a system failure.

=== What are stored procedures and triggers? Give examples of when you might use them.

==== Stored Procedures:
Precompiled collections of SQL statements stored in the database.
* Example: Automating complex operations like monthly payroll processing.

==== Triggers:
SQL code executed automatically in response to certain events on a table.
* Example: Automatically updating inventory counts when an order is placed.

=== Designing a Database Schema for an E-commerce Application

==== Users Table:
* user_id (PK), name, email (Unique), password, address.

==== Products Table:
* product_id (PK), name, description, price, stock.

==== Orders Table:
* order_id (PK), user_id (FK), order_date, status.

==== OrderItems Table:
* order_item_id (PK), order_id (FK), product_id (FK), quantity, price.

=== Main Differences Between SQL and NoSQL Databases:

==== SQL Databases:
* Structured schema and tables.
* Use SQL for defining and manipulating data.
* Suitable for complex queries and transactions.
* Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.

==== NoSQL Databases:
* Flexible schema (schemaless).
* Store data in various formats: document, key-value, wide-column, graph.
* Designed for horizontal scalability.
* Examples: Redis, MongoDB, Cassandra.

=== When to Choose a NoSQL Database Over a SQL Database:

* Flexibility: When you need to store and manage unstructured or semi-structured data.
* Scalability: When you need to handle large-scale data across many distributed servers.
* Performance: When low-latency data access is critical, such as in real-time applications.
* Complex Relationships: When you require specialised data models, like graph databases for connected data.
* Rapid Development: When frequent changes to the data model are expected.

=== Types of NoSQL Databases:

==== Document-Based:
* Description: Stores data in JSON-like documents, each document is a self-contained unit of data.
* Use Cases: Content management systems, user profiles, e-commerce data.
* Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB.

==== Key-Value Stores:
* Description: Stores data as key-value pairs, where a key is a unique identifier.
* Use Cases: Caching, session management, user preferences.
* Examples: Redis, DynamoDB, Riak.

==== Columnar/Column-Family Stores:
* Description: Stores data in columns rather than rows; columns are grouped into column families.
* Use Cases: Analytical applications, real-time data processing, event logging.
* Examples: Cassandra, HBase.

==== Graph Databases:
* Description: Stores data as nodes, edges, and properties to represent and traverse relationships.
* Use Cases: Social networks, recommendation engines, fraud detection.
* Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, ArangoDB.

=== Is it optimal to set multiple indices to columns?

Setting multiple indexes can be beneficial for improving query performance, but it's crucial to strike a balance between performance gains and overhead.
