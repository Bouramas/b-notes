== REST API questions

=== Endpoints and HTTP Methods:

Describe the RESTful endpoints and HTTP methods you would use to manage a blog system with posts, comments, and authors. How would you handle CRUD operations for each resource?

==== Posts:

[source,http]
GET /posts
GET /posts/{id}
POST /posts
PUT /posts/{id}
DELETE /posts/{id}

==== Comments:

[source,http]
GET /posts/{postId}/comments
POST /posts/{postId}/comments
DELETE /comments/{id}

==== Authors:

[source,http]
GET /authors
GET /authors/{id}
POST /authors
PUT /authors/{id}
DELETE /authors/{id}

=== Authentication and Authorization:

How would you implement authentication and authorization in a REST API? Can you describe the differences between session-based authentication and token-based authentication, and explain which you would choose for a scalable application?

==== Session-Based Authentication:

- Uses cookies to store session identifiers.
- Simple to implement, suitable for web applications.
- Issues with scalability and CSRF vulnerabilities.

==== Token-Based Authentication:

- Uses tokens (e.g., JWT) in HTTP headers.
- Stateless, more scalable, suitable for APIs.
- More secure, but requires careful handling of token storage and expiration.

==== Choice:
For a scalable application, token-based authentication is preferred.

=== Versioning:

How do you handle versioning in a REST API? What are the pros and cons of different versioning strategies (e.g., URI versioning, header versioning)?

==== URI Versioning:
https://api.example.com/v1/resources

- Easy to implement and understand.
- Visible in the URL.
- Requires changes in client URLs.

==== Header Versioning:
Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json

- Clean URLs.
- Requires clients to set headers.
- Less discoverable.

==== Query Parameter Versioning:
https://api.example.com/resources?version=1

- Flexible, easy to test.
- Adds complexity to URL parsing.

==== Choice:
Depends on use case; URI versioning is straightforward and commonly used.

=== Error Handling and Status Codes:

What strategies do you use for error handling in a REST API? Can you provide examples of appropriate HTTP status codes for different types of errors and describe how you would format error responses to be consistent and informative?

==== Examples of HTTP Status Codes:

- 400 Bad Request: Client sent an invalid request.
- 401 Unauthorized: Authentication is required.
- 403 Forbidden: Client is authenticated but does not have permission.
- 404 Not Found: Resource does not exist.
- 500 Internal Server Error: Server encountered an unexpected condition.

==== Consistent Error Responses:
Use a standard format (e.g., JSON) with fields like `errorCode`, `message`, `details`.
