== General Development Questions

=== What are the different types of testing commonly used in software development?

* **Unit Testing**:
  Tests individual units or components of the software to validate each unit's functionality in isolation.
* **Integration Testing**:
  Verifies interactions between integrated components to ensure they work together as expected.
* **System Testing**:
  Evaluates the entire system's behaviour to ensure it meets specified requirements and functions correctly.
* **Acceptance Testing**:
  Validates that the software meets business requirements and is ready for deployment.
* **Performance Testing**:
  Assesses how the system performs under various conditions, such as load, stress, and scalability.
* **Security Testing**:
  Checks the software for vulnerabilities and ensures it protects data and resources from unauthorised access.
* **Regression Testing**:
  Re-runs previously executed tests to verify that recent changes have not adversely affected existing functionality.
* **Smoke Testing**:
  Conducts basic tests on the critical functionalities of the software to ensure stability before proceeding with further testing.
* **Usability Testing**:
  Evaluates how user-friendly and intuitive the software is for end-users.

=== Design Patterns

Can you explain some commonly used design patterns in software development?

Patterns help solve recurring design problems in software development and promote code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability.

* **Creational Patterns**:
  Provide mechanisms for creating objects in a manner suitable for the situation.
  * *Factory Method*: Defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.
  * *Singleton*: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
* **Structural Patterns**:
  Focus on how objects are composed to form larger structures.
  * *Adapter*: Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
  * *Decorator*: Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects without subclassing.
* **Behavioural Patterns**:
  Deal with the interaction and communication between objects.
  * *Observer*: Defines a dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
  * *Strategy*: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

=== SOLID Principles

* **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
* **Open/Closed Principle**
* **Liskovâ€™s Substitution Principle (LSP)**
* **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
* **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

=== What are the 12 Factor App principles and how do they influence modern software development?

The twelve-factor app is a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps that:

* Use declarative formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project.
* Have a clean contract with the underlying operating system, offering maximum portability between execution environments.
* Are suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms, obviating the need for servers and systems administration.
* Minimize divergence between development and production, enabling continuous deployment for maximum agility.
* And can scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices.

I. **Codebase**: One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys.
II. **Dependencies**: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies.
III. **Config**: Store config in the environment.
IV. **Backing services**: Treat backing services as attached resources.
V. **Build, release, run**: Strictly separate build and run stages.
VI. **Processes**: Execute the app as one or more stateless processes.
VII. **Port binding**: Export services via port binding.
VIII. **Concurrency**: Scale out via the process model.
IX. **Disposability**: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown.
X. **Dev/prod parity**: Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible.
XI. **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams.
XII. **Admin processes**: Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes.

=== What are the principles of clean code? What is clean code for you?

* **Readability**: Code should be easy to understand and follow, like well-written prose.
* **Simplicity**: Keep code simple and concise; complexity should be minimized.
* **Consistency**: Follow consistent coding conventions and patterns throughout the codebase.
* **Modularity**: Encapsulate functionality into small, focused units (functions, classes) with clear responsibilities.
* **Naming**: Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, classes, etc.
* **Comments**: Write clear comments that explain why something is done, not what is done (code should be self-explanatory).
* **Testing**: Ensure thorough testing to verify correctness and maintainability.
* **Refactoring**: Continuously improve the design of the codebase without changing its external behavior.

=== What is the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern? When would you use it?

**Definition**: Separates an application into three interconnected components: Model (data), View (user interface), and Controller (handles user input).

**Purpose**: Enhances code organisation, modularity, and maintainability in applications with separate concerns.

**Use Cases**: Ideal for web applications where separation of concerns is crucial, allowing different teams to work on different parts independently.

=== Describe the difference between microservices and monolithic architectures.

==== Microservices:
**Definition**: Architectural style where an application is composed of small, independent services that communicate over a network.

**Characteristics**: Each service is self-contained, can be developed and deployed independently, often using different technologies.

**Advantages**: Scalability, flexibility, resilience to failures, and easier adoption of new technologies.

==== Monolithic Architectures:
**Definition**: Traditional architectural style where the entire application is built as a single, indivisible unit.

**Characteristics**: All components tightly coupled, sharing the same codebase and usually deployed together.

**Advantages**: Simplicity in development and deployment, easier to maintain in smaller applications.
